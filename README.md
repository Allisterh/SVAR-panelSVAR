## Overview
This repository facilitates the calculation of Vector Autoregression (VAR), Structural Vector Autoregression (SVAR), and panel SVAR. The panel SVAR methodologies are based on the work of Pedroni, P. (2013), published in Econometrics, 1(2), 180-206. You can access the paper [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics1020180).

## Current Status
Variance decomposition and bootstrapping are currently in development.
