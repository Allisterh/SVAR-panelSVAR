# panelSVAR
Developed by Gavin Xia as part of ECON 371 (Time Series Econometrics) final project.
Calculates VAR, SVAR, and panel SVAR. Panel SVAR methods are from
Pedroni, P. (2013), Econometrics, 1(2), 180-206; https://doi.org/10.3390/econometrics1020180

Code still in development. Use for ECON 371 only (for now).
Do NOT try to crash the code! I have not implemented much error handling.
Incorrect input could lead to incorrect output.

Your contribution is much appreciated! Feel free to fork a branch and make improvements.
Please contact Gavin Xia at gx1@williams.edu to make contributions or use the code for projects.
